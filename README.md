This is not responsive version and i will make it responsive as soon as i can 

## What i use in this project :
* HTML / CSS 
* Tailwind css 
* Vanilla JS 

## The purpose of this project
In this project i try to show some Modal box and some Css skill . As you can see my code is not so clean but i promise that i will learn Clean-code very soon  :boom:

## How scores are calculated :
In this project you can put many questions in "quizData Array" .

For example you put 50 questions in "quizData" ;

If all your answers were correct you get 3 stars :star2:

If more than 50% of the answers were correct you get 2 stars :star2:

If less than 50% of the answers were correct you get 1 stars :star2:

And if your answere were false completely you cant get star !
